# COSC4P02Project Chatbot Project Proposal 

Objective</br> 
Our objective is to create a JavaScript based chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) for Brock University. This software is intended to be used by current and future Brock students. There are two categories of questions that the software will provide answers to: (1) specific course information and (2) general information regarding Brock University.</br>
1.	Specific course information:
•	A description of the course 
•	Required prerequisites 
•	Course delivery details (the instructor, time and location of lectures, labs, seminars, etc) </br>

2.	General information regarding Brock University:</br>
•	Important university dates (non-penalty course withdrawal, exam dates, break dates, etc)
•	Department information 
•	Transit details 
•	The university’s main page events and news, as well information regarding the campus</br>


To develop this software, we have a team of 8 people using SCRUM methodology. The chatbot will aim to provide users with human-like responses to their queries without the need of human agents. Not only will this serve a larger group of customers, it will also alleviate human resources that can be used elsewhere. The chatbot application will be integrated into the existing website of Brock University for ease of use by Brock students.
