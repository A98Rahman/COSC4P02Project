It is a relatively new, but rapidly advancing field encompassing a wide variety of areas in natural and life sciences and uses all methods of scientific inquiry: theory, experiment and large scale computer simulation to understand living systems at the molecular level. Biophysics also forms the basis of many aspects of Medical Physics, another rapidly developing field in much demand at the current time. Brock's biophysics program will provide the students with a superb learning environment and exciting research opportunities. Extended research opportunities are available through Brock's participation in the Interdepartmental Biophysics Group (BIG) based at the University of Guelph.  The interdisciplinary nature of the Biophysics program offers an opportunity to modify the sequence of courses to be taken, to reflect better the interests of the individual students. However, this places a greater onus on the students to make sure that the prerequisites are satisfied, and that a sufficient number of credits at each level is included. Biophysics students are strongly encouraged to contact the Co-ordinator no later than year 2 of their studies, to ensure that their chosen sequence of courses satisfies all academic constraints.  In view of the vastness of the field of Biophysics and the enormous diversity among its various subfields, the program offers a high degree of flexibility to its students at the 4th year level in terms of choice of BIOL, BTEC, CHEM, KINE, PHYS and PSYC\/NEUR courses.  Eligibility to continue in the program is based on the student's major average. All courses required for the program, excluding the electives, will be considered for the major average.  Biophysics is an Honours only program. If a student's major average falls below the required 70 percent average by year three, they are advised to seek a three-year BSc Degree in General Studies. Students should note that such a degree requires a minimum of five credits in one subject.",
