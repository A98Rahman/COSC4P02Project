The program is designed to provide the student with a broad base in modern biological thought, to fulfill the basic requirements for admission to professional and advanced degree studies and to prepare graduates for careers in the biological sciences and related fields. Although the undergraduate program provides students with flexibility in selecting the areas of biology most compatible with their interests and skills, it also ensures that students develop an overview of the major concepts and problems of modern biology as expressed at all levels of biological organization.  The objectives of the undergraduate program are realized through a group of core courses in years 1 and 2, each with an associated laboratory. Laboratory classes stress the investigative approach to experimental studies. Students move progressively from structured laboratory studies to increasingly independent investigations and in the honours year undertake individual research projects. Working from the core program, students may follow a variety of curriculum patterns to satisfy their interests.  Students must consult faculty advisers when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.  The honours year provides students with the opportunity for either broadening their understanding of the biological sciences or for increased specialization. Ideally, the honours program provides an opportunity for the synthesis of material presented in earlier years. Students must apply to the Department of Biological Sciences in order to be admitted to year 4 (honours).  Prerequisite requirements are strictly enforced in Biological Sciences courses. Students lacking prerequisites will be automatically deregistered from courses. Students are encouraged to plan their courses two years ahead in order to ensure that appropriate prerequisites are obtained.  Students should be aware that numerous year 3 and 4 courses are offered in alternating years.

One credit from PHYS 1P21, 1P22, 1P91 is strongly recommended for students who do not have 4U Physics.  4. The third ancillary science credit must be numbered 1(alpha)00 to 2(alpha)99 and offered by a department in the Faculty of Mathematics and Science other than Biological Sciences, excluding ASTR 1P01, 1P02, CHEM 1P00, ERSC 1P92, 1P94, SCIE 1P50, 1P51, 1P52, BTEC courses, OEVI courses and MATH courses numbered 1(alpha)00 to 1(alpha)99. An organic chemistry course numbered 2(alpha)00 to 2(alpha)99 is recommended.  5. BIOL 2P95 does not carry major credit for the BSc (Honours) degree.

For combined BIOL\/CHEM majors, honours students who elect BIOL 4F90, 4F91 and who have taken only the minimum five credits in CHEM in years 1 through 3 may experience difficulty in obtaining the necessary two additional CHEM credits in year 4.  8. For combined BIOL\/PSYC majors one of BIOL 4F90 and 4F91, BIOL 4F92, PSYC 4F91 is required.  9.
