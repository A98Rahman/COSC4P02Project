The program seeks to develop the skills and knowledge required for such tasks. Possible fields of employment include financial analysis, market research and managerial positions in the private and public sectors.  Business Economics offers a four-year program of study leading to an Honours BBE degree designed for students who wish to combine the study of economics and business. There are two streams: Financial Economics for those who wish to combine economics with finance and Consumer Economics for those who wish to combine economics with marketing. Students must declare their stream by the end of Year 2.  The Business Economics Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a period of four and one-half academic years. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the functional areas of business economics prior to taking the first work placement. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).  Eligibility to continue in the Business Economics Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Business Economics Co-op program. If a student subsequently raises his\/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee.  All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca\/co-op\/current-students\/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.  Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.  The Business Economics Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.  Computer Literacy is required for some economics. Students who are not computer literate should consider taking APCO 1P01 or 1P93 as an elective.  Graduates of the Business Economics program may normally pursue graduate studies in Economics or Business Economics without taking additional courses.",
