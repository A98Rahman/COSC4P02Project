Brock students are involved in the analysis, synthesis and purification of substances, determining their structures and properties and explaining the mechanisms of processes.  Our programs stress chemical principles and practice through research in organic, inorganic, analytical, physical and theoretical chemistry, with a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary fields of bio-inorganic and bio-organic chemistry and chemical biophysics. Research interests of the department include development of new chiral ligands, organometallic reagents, and methods for asymmetric synthesis, green chemistry including bacterial dioxygenase-mediated degradation of aromatics, new approaches in natural product synthesis emphasizing morphine alkaloids, design and synthesis of fluorinated inhalation anesthetic agents and unnatural oligo-saccharide conjugates, ligand design and crystal engineering aimed at self-assembly of novel molecule-based materials, organic electrochemistry, energetics of photosynthesis studied by time-resolved electron spin resonance of short-lived paramagnetic intermediates, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, organometallic mass spectrometry, quantum and computational chemistry, pesticide and trace element analysis, protein affinity labelling and protein-lipid interactions, and structure-activity correlations of anticancer pharmaceuticals.  The Honours program in Chemistry is designed to give the student a broad knowledge of chemistry as well as depth in areas in which the student is most interested. A research project must be successfully completed and a thesis written as part of the requirements for an Honours degree. The Honours program and certain combined Honours programs listed below, when taken with CHEM electives, satisfy the requirements for membership in the Chemical Institute of Canada and are the normal requirements for admission to graduate school in chemistry.  The Chemistry Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a four and one half year period. Students spend two years in an academic setting, where they acquire the necessary background prior to taking the first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Chemistry provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Chemistry Co-op students are assessed an annual administrative fee (see the Schedule of Fees).  Eligibility to continue in the Co-op program is based on the student's major average and non-major average. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average will be permitted to continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Chemistry Co-op program, but may continue in the non Co-op Chemistry stream. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Department of Chemistry.  All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca\/co-op\/current-students\/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.  Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.  The requirement for graduation with a Chemistry (Honours) degree is a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average. The Chemistry Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.  The equipment available in the Mackenzie Chown and Cairns Family Health and Bioscience Research Complexes is actively used for both teaching and research. Undergraduate students gain hands-on experience in operating modern equipment for separating of complex mixtures, determining molecular structures, and making quantitative measurements. Newer equipment is computer-controlled and is connected to the University's Ethernet backbone. Student and faculty researchers have access to cluster platform systems, housed at Brock Univeristy and other SHARCNet academic institutions.  Instrumentation includes 300, 400 and 600 MHz NMR cryospectrometers for high-resolution solution and solids studies. Mass spectrometry facilities include a Thermo DFS high resolution mass spectrometer with EI, CI and FAB ion sources. It is equipped with a high performance capillary GC system. The lab also contains a Bruker HCT Ultra LC\/MS system with ESI and APCI interfaces and a BrukerAutoflex II TOF\/TOF MALDI system. For X-ray crystallography, a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer, equipped with an Oxford low temperature device, is available for the collection of single crystal data. A number of spectroscopic instruments are available in the research laboratories including time-resolved EPR, ICP and ICP\/MS, FTIR, UV\/Visible, fluorescence cuvette and microplate fluorimeters. There are several chromatography systems for HPLC, FPLC and capillary GC analysis. A state-of-the-art biotechnology research lab was recently equipped for biochemistry and microbiology work. This instrumentation is augmented by a range of modern facilities available through the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute, which support work in biochemistry, especially work involving proteins, nucleic acids, yeasts and bacteria.  Students should consult the Department Chair when planning years 3 and 4 of the BSc (Honours) and BSc with Major programs, or year 3 of the BSc (Pass) program.  In addition to its own programs, the Chemistry department participates in combined major programs with five other departments\/centres and is also a major participant in the Biochemistry, Biotechnology, and Oenology and Viticulture programs.",
