In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Co-op students are assessed an annual administration fee (see the Schedule of Fees).  Eligibility to continue is based on the student's major average and non-major average. Students will be required to maintain a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average in order to continue in the Co-op program. If a student subsequently raises the student's major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Computer Science Co-op Admissions Committee.  All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manual (brocku.ca/co-op/current-students/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.  Students must register for each four-month co-operative education work term. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment.
