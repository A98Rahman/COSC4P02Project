Biotechnology has been used for centuries in fermentation and the making of bread and cheese, but today involves new scientific tools like genetic and protein engineering, cell fusion and production of monoclonal antibodies. Biotechnology is a strategic technology and an important economic component of industrialized nations. Biotechnology at Brock is a joint effort of the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, with courses drawn from both departments plus courses designed specifically for the program.  The Biotechnology Co-op program combines academic and work terms over a period of five academic years. Students spend two years in an academic setting studying the fundamentals of Biotechnology prior to their first work placement. Successful completion of courses in the core areas of Biotechnology provides the necessary academic background for the work experience. In addition to the current fees for courses in academic study terms, Biotechnology Co-op students are assessed an administrative fee for each work term (see the Schedule of Fees).  Eligibility to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program is based on the student's major and non-major averages. A student with a minimum 70 percent major average and a minimum 60 percent non-major average may continue. A student with a major average lower than 70 percent will not be permitted to continue in the Biotechnology Co-op program, but may continue in the non-co-op Biotechnology stream. If a student subsequently raises his\/her major average to 70 percent, the student may be readmitted only if approved by the Co-op Admissions Committee. For further information, see the Co-op Programs section of the Calendar, and contact the Centre for Biotechnology.  All students in the Co-operative Education program are required to read, sign and adhere to the terms of the Student Regulations Waiver and Co-op Student Manuals (brocku.ca\/co-op\/current-students\/co-op-student-manuals) as articulated by the Co-op Programs Office. In addition, eligibility to continue in the co-op option is based on the student's major average and non-major average, and the ability to demonstrate the motivation and potential to pursue a professional career.  Each four-month co-operative education work term must be registered. Once students are registered in a co-op work term, they are expected to fulfill their commitment. If the placement accepted is for more than one four-month work term, students are committed to complete all terms. Students may not withdraw from or terminate a work term without permission from the Director, Co-op Program Office.  The Biotechnology Co-op program designation will be awarded to those students who have honours standing and who have successfully completed a minimum of twelve months of Co-op work experience.",
